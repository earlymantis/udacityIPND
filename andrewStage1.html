  <div class="description">Welcome to <em><b>MY</b></em> webpage. This
              webpage is designed to be a list of the reasons that I'm taking
              this Udacity course. I hope you like it, but without further
              ado:

<div class="reasons">
  <h2>My reasons:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I want a new career</li>
      <li>I've always wanted to become a programmer</li>
      <li>My graduate degree taught me R, data analysis, and machine learning
      but that's not enough -- <u><b>I want more</b></u></li>
    </ol>
